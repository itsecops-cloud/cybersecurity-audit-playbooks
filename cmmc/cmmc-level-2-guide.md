# CMMC Level 2 Readiness Guide

## What Is CMMC Level 2?

Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Level 2 maps directly to NIST SP 800-171 controls. It is required for many US Department of Defense contractors and organizations handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

CMMC Level 2 readiness requires:
- Implementation of 110 NIST SP 800-171 controls
- Evidence that controls operate consistently
- Auditor-ready documentation

---

## 1. Scope & Controlled Unclassified Information

Begin by identifying:
- Information systems in scope  
- Data classified as CUI  
- Boundaries between controlled & uncontrolled environments

This drives control selection and evidence requirements.

---

## 2. Controls Implementation

Implement NIST 800-171 controls under these families:
- Access Control (AC)
- Audit & Accountability (AU)
- Configuration Management (CM)
- Incident Response (IR)
- Security Assessment (CA)

Technical enforcement must yield:
- Logs
- Alerts
- Policy configurations

---

## 3. Evidence Collection & Assessment

Auditors expect:
- System logs
- Access logs
- Configuration snapshots
- Incident response records

Design evidence sources with retention schedules aligned to Defense assessor expectations.

---

## 4. Remediation & POA&M

CMMC readiness requires accurate Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M):
- Each control gap must have a POA&M entry
- POA&M must include:
  - Gap description
  - Risk impact
  - Remediation plan
  - Target dates

---

## 5. Pre-Assessment & Gap Closure

Before a formal assessment:
- Conduct an internal gap assessment
- Validate evidence for each control
- Prepare remediation documentation

This reduces assessor findings and saves time.

---

## Summary

CMMC Level 2 readiness blends NIST SP 800-171 implementation with audit evidence maturity. The focus is on real-world enforcement and traceability.
